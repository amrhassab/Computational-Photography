Energy image:

The energy image shows when there is a large contrast from one area to the other ( from dark to light or vise versa ). For example, you can see that the energy image is very bright around the circumference of the yellow tables. This indicates a sharp change in intensity from deck to table.

Cumulative Energy image:

Here we can see the progression from left to right of the cumulative energy. namely we start with low values (blue) and as we move to the right they gradually get higher (yellow/orange); in the last column the pixels with the lowest energy path leading to them will be bluish while those of which have a high energy path will appear orangish.

Experiment 4:

Here picking a large value for the number columns to be removed works well because there is a lot of hight energy seams on the right side of the image which is predominately white

Experiment 5:


I started with an especially detailed image and shrunk it by large dimensions to try to promote a bad result.
Our result definitely shows more artifacts blurring than usual because of the two reasons (detailed, large area to be removed)
