Artifact was taken from bottom left of P2-crayons-error.

This error is very small and seems to be at the blue crayon right above the areas wrapped in paper and right below the writing tip cone of the blue crayon.

In the original picture we can see small amounts of white generated by light glaring over the curve of the crayon. This might be the reason for the error in question because that area is mostly blue and using an averaging filter like we have may have added more blue in areas that are supposed to show white glare.
