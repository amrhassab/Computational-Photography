# Computational-Photography
This project is the reult of the class CS534 - Computational Photogrpahy I took at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. This was one of the more intresting classes I took while finishing my Electrical Engineering and Computer Science degrees and I thought to share some of the cool image manipulation functions we made. It was very intriguing to see math interact with images to produce surprising results. 

# Contents:
This project consists of my submissions for the homework assignments outlined here: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dyer/cs534/hw-toc.html. If current UW students come across this, I can't stop you from cheating but I would highly suggest considering another career path if you really feel the need to cheat for this course. The homeworks may seem challenging at first but they pretty much tell you what to do step by step. Homework number one is not included here because it is only for trying out software and no code was produced.

# Homework 2: Image Processing in MATLAB
 
 ## Problem 1: Histogram Equalization
 Here we use image histograms to inhance thier contrast. We create our histogram manipulation function in 
 
 
 - demosaicing
 - color transfer
 
HW3
 - seam carving
 
HW4
- Panorama Synthysis
