# Computational Photography
This course explores computational image manipulaiton methods using matlab. It introduced me to the very interesting niche of media processing and was a fun and enjoyable learning experience.  

This repository consists of my submissions for the homework assignments outlined here: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dyer/cs534/hw-toc.html. Homework number one is not included here because no code is produced to complete it.

Each homework has its own page and can be reaced with these links:

1. [Homework 2: Image Processing in MATLAB](HW2_matlab_image_processing/README.md)
     * Problem 1: Histogram Equalization
     * Problem 2: Demosaicing
     * Problem 3: Color Transfer
  
2. [Homework 3: Image Resizing using Seam Carving](HW3_seam_carving/README.md)
3. [Homework 4: Making Panoramas](HW4_panoramas/README.md)

Although the solutions are mine please keep in mind that the course itself (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dyer/cs534/index.html) does not belong to me. Also some of the steps described here are paraphrased from the homework assignments themselves which also do not belong to me.
