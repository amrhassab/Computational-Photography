# Computational-Photography
This project consists of all my homework assignment submissions for the class CS534 - Computational Photogrpahy I took at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. This was one of the more intresting classes I took while finishing my Electrical Engineering and Computer Science degrees and I thought to share some of the cool image manipulation functions we made. It was very intriguing to see math interact with images to produce surprising results.
